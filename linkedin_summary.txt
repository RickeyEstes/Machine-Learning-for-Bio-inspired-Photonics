Summary

I am a data scientist/postdoc specialising in the field of bio-inspired photonics.
My current work focuses on machine learning analysis on large datasets of dirty optical signals. This type of problem cannot be solved by conventional methods because of the complexity of the data introduced by disorder, non-uniformity and irregularity that are commonly found in bio-photonic structures. I developed a machine learning technique that enables access to statistical information and detailed structural information both, which was previously not possible without a quantum computer. Please feel free to message me if you would like to know more about this project.


As a Scientific Software Architect of my current research group, I am fully responsible of our in-house software for data acquisition and hardware control. I wrote most of the core programs that are used in our group and distribute them using a version controlling system that I established. I give guidance’s to student programmers and make important design decisions in order to maintain and further develop the architecture of our clean, efficient, dependable and reusable programs. The following are examples of my own work in the group.
