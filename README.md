Briliant colours found in nature are often not created from pigments, but are results of light interacting with extrodinarily intricate structures that are about 100 times smaller than human hair.
Nature's shiniest blue fruit of Pollia Condensata, also known for its ever-lasting colour, uses cellulose microfibrils to make such structure.
Inspired by the Pollia fruit, we study cellulos in order to create materials with such structural colour for sensors and 

Understanding the underlying principle of the formation process is important for uncovering the formation process of these structures in nature, which will give us insight of their design strategies, allowing us to creat novel iridescent materials inspired by these natural examples is important for application. 
 CNCs are cool material because of bio-inspired reasons, sustainability reasons, photonic reasons, nano reasons, biocompatibility reasons and so on. Therefore it is very important to understand the structural property so that we can make cool materials.

However, studying bio and bio-inspired photonic structures, including CNCs are never easy because of the interplay of order and disorder. In well ordered systems, quantitative optical models can be straightforwardly applied for modelling optical signals. These models include transfer matrix method, Berreman's method. The output of these models can be directly used for interpreting the properties of the photonic structures, which makes them powerful tools for studying photonic structures.

However, these mathematical methods start to show shortcomings when it is used for analysing photonic structures that has complex structures, for example when they contain multiple domains with different periodicity or when they have defects. In such cases, the number of relevant parameters grows as the complexity of the system increases, which makes the parameter optimisation difficult. This type of problem is common in non-linear optimisation. It is because many variable functions have lots of local minimum, which makes it extremely difficult for conventional optimisation algorithm to find the global minimum, unless the constraints  that are used for the optimisation are finely adjusted prior to the optimisation. This means that analysis of complex data have to rely on manual intervention based on prior knowledge of the structure. Even if a simpler approaches are employed, for example by fitting the data to a simple mathematical function rather than a rigorous model, the fact that the correctness of any optimisation method relies on constraints does not change. Therefore, analysis of complex data will always remain difficult to automate, until the day when quantum computer becomes readily available, which is not expected to happen in the near future.

This may sound as a bad news for natural photonics analysis because in nature, disorder, irregularity, non-uniformity and other factors that introduces variations in the optical response are found very commonly. For a concrete characterisation of such structures, one must investigate the statistical nature of the system without loosing grasp of the detailed structural information, which is difficult because the data analysis process is practically impossible to be automated. This fundamental problem has not been confronted properly in previous studies, but was avoided by resorting to crude treatments. These treatments includes introducing arbitral randomness in layer thicknesses in multilayer systems and averaging over angles in 3D photonic crystals, which improved the agreement of the models with experimental results in a qualitative sense, such as broadening of peaks and loss of side fringes, but were unable to reproduce the experimental results with good quantitative agreement.


In this work, we uncover the complex structure of cnc films by a novel method driven by machine learning. Machine learning is showing very cool developments in the recent years and becoming increasingly popular for applications such as recommendation systems, face detection and spam email filtering. The blooming of machine learning is mainly driven by the increase in available computing power and also because of new methods being developed. For example, alphago is really cool. Machine learning is good at dealing with problems involving pattern recognition and classification. We demonstrate that such strength of machine learning can give a dramatical enhancement to for optimisation problems the shortfalls of conventional optimisation methods. In the field of photonics, this hasnâ€™t been done.
