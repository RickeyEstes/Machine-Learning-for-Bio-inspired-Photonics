Briliant colours found in nature are often not created from pigments, but are results of light interacting with extrodinarily intricate structures that are about 100 times smaller than human hair. Nature's shiniest blue fruit of Pollia Condensata, also known for its ever-lasting colour, uses cellulose microfibrils to make such structure. Inspired by the Pollia fruit, we study cellulos in order to create materials with such structural colour for sensing, security printing and other applications.

Understanding the relationship between colour and structure is important for developing our materials but this turns out to be an extremely difficult task. This is because bio-photonic structures often incoorporates disorder, non-uniformity and irregularity, which makes the optical response of these materials very complicated and difficult to analise. In order to build an optical model that truely represents our materials, it is important to characterise their structures in small regions and also have an overview of the entire material at the same time, however conventional methods are practically not useful for solving our problems.  This is because we almost always have to manually optimise the parameters of the models, which means we can't automate the modeling process effectively, which means that we don't have access to statistical properties of the material because we cannot process large ammount of data.

This type of difficulty is caused by a fundamental limitation of non-linear optimisation, which is the fact that the output of the optimisation processes heavily relies on constraints and starting points. Because there is no general method to automaticaly produce good constraints and starting points, the optimisation program can easily fall into a "local minimum" rather than a "global minimum", which is what we want to find. Quantum computers are expected to be able find the "global minimum" very effectively, however they are still in the stage of research and are not available for us.
