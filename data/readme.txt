Description of data
===================

spectra.csv
2601 spectra, taken as a 51 x 51 2D scan.
One spectrum per one column.
Each row represents a wavelength (evenly spaced between 422.15 -  851.77 nm).
This is the data used for creating the 3 figures shown in README.md.

train.csv
The beginning 200 samples of spectra.csv.

test.csv
201-300th sample of spectra.csv.

labels_train.csv and labels_test.csv indicate the numbers of peaks of each spectrum.



Some advice
The provided train and test set are just an example of how you can prepare a dataset for the machine learning modelling.  
The best results may be achieved by creating your own dataset, including the labels.
